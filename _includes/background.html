    <p>
      Hello, I’m Md. Rubel, a Senior Software Engineer specializing in iOS
      application development. Over the past six years, I’ve built and scaled
      applications across industries including <strong>telecom</strong>,
      <strong>ed-tech</strong>, <strong>fin-tech</strong>,
      <strong>ride-sharing</strong>, <strong>healthcare</strong> and utilities —
      delivering products that serve thousands of users worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
      My expertise goes beyond writing Swift code. I focus on
      <strong>architecting scalable solutions</strong>, implementing
      <strong>clean, testable, and maintainable codebases</strong>, and aligning
      technical execution with business goals. Whether leading the development
      of a flagship app or modernizing a legacy system, I approach every project
      with the same principle:
      <strong
        >deliver reliable, future-ready software that creates impact.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also deeply curious about
      <strong>networking, smart home automation, and embedded systems</strong>,
      which keeps my perspective broad and my problem-solving versatile. Outside
      of work, I’m passionate about travel and exploring different cultures—a
      mindset that often inspires fresh ways to think about technology and user
      experience.
